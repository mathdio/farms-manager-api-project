# 🧑‍🌾 Farms Manager API

A farms manager and monitorer API, developed as a [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com) Project.

## 💻 About this project

This is a API built in Java and using Spring framework, with which the user can monitor and manager a system of farms and theirs crops. 

The API has endpoints that allow the users to: register new farms, set a crop to a farm, search farms by ID, search all farms, search for all crops from a farm, register a fertilizer, set a fertilizer to a crop, search for crops by harvest date, get all fertilizers, get a fertilizer by ID and get all fertilizers from a crop. Besides, an endpoint allows the users to create a person: a profile used by the application to manage the authentication and authorization. 
The available endpoints are listed in a section below. 

Some files were provided by [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com), as the tables diagram in `/images` folder.

## 🏁 Getting started

### 🐋 Installing Docker and Docker Compose

As the project is containerized, to run the application you will need to install Docker and Docker
Compose. The Docker version used in this project was 24.0.7. You can
see [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04)
how to install it. The Docker Compose version supported by the project is 1.29 or higher. You can
see [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-20-04-pt)
or in the [docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) how to install it.

> ⚠️ <b>Before containers creation</b>:
>
> This project has a seeder for the farms table. If you want to unable it, you must comment
> the `com/betrybe/agrix/initializer/DatabaseSeeder.java` file content before run the commands bellow.

### 📦🏃‍♀ Creating Docker containers and running the application

In project root terminal, run:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Once the container is created (or after starting the container), the application will start running
automatically, unless the port 8080 is already in use. You can start the container
with `docker start agrix-app` after stopping the process using the port 8080. You can stop the
containers running `docker stop agrix-app` or `docker stop agrix-db`.

## 🛣️ Available endpoints

To use the API services you will can use a web browser or a client for APIs testing,
like [Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.com) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download).
The API endpoints are listed in the table below, as well as some examples of request body after the
table.

Services and endpoints:
| Service | Method | Endpoint |
|  :---:  | :----: | :------: |
| Register a farm | POST | http://localhost:8080/farms |
| Set a crop | POST | http://localhost:8080/farms/{farmId}/crops |
| Register a fertilizer | POST | http://localhost:8080/fertilizers |
| Set a fertilizer | POST | http://localhost:8080/crops/{cropId}/fertilizers/{fertilizerId} |
| Get all farms | GET | http://localhost:8080/farms |
| Get a farm by ID | GET | http://localhost:8080/farms/{farmId} |
| Get all crops from a farm | GET | http://localhost:8080/farms/{farmId}/crops |
| Search for crops by harvest date | GET | http://localhost:8080/crops/search?start=yyyy-mm-dd&end=yyyy-mm-dd |
| Get all fertilizers | GET | http://localhost:8080/fertilizers |
| Get a fertilizer by ID | GET | http://localhost:8080/fertilizers/{id} |
| Get all fertilizers from a crop | GET | http://localhost:8080/crops/{cropId}/fertilizers |


> Request body example to register a farm:
> ```
> {
>  "name": "cenoura",
>  "size": 10
> }
> ```


> Request body example to set a crop:
> ```
> {
>  "name": "cenoura",
>  "plantedArea": 5.43
> }
> ```

> To set a crop to a farm, you must pass the farm ID in the endpoint, as
> in `http://localhost:8080/farms/1/crops`

> To search crops by harvest date, two dates must be passed in the start and end parameters,
> as in `http://localhost:8080/crops/search?start=2023-01-07&end=2024-01-10`

> To set a fertilizer to a crop, you must pass the crop ID to which you want to associate the fertilizer and the fertilizer ID you want to associate,
> as in `http://localhost:8080/crops/1/fertilizers/1`

## 🧪 Testing
In project root terminal, run:
```
mvn test
```
Or for execute only one test class, run:
```
mvn test -Dtest="TestClassName"
```
